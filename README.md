# Potato-Disease-Detection-Using-CNN
 
The project aims to detect plant diseases in Potato plant leaves. The model aims to classify the input leaf in one of the classes, viz. Early Blight, Late Blight, Healthy. The model uses CNN to do the job. Though the model training part went well, the project could not be deployed as it was facing some error at the moment during deployment at server.
